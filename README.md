# ShowCallStack IdaPython Script

Often I encounter a problem during debugging with IDA, because I want check a call stack but there is no such option. There is trace availibity, but it is not user friendly. Therefore I decided to invent ShowCallStack.py script with IDAPython, which display call stack during debugging.

I used some ideas from "CallStackWalk.py" (https://github.com/EiNSTeiN-/idapython/blob/master/Scripts/CallStackWalk.py), eg. idea of determining of instruction.
